jbnq5e9,reddevils,11nl59m,He was clearly signaling for a substitution. Pellistri misread it and high 5 him.,
jbnpoh0,reddevils,11nl59m,"I'll never forget Bruno standing behind Ole while the crowd booed him, gesturing that the players should share the blame and that it was on all of them, not just Ole. 

How can anyone believe that this man was demanding to be subbed off when we were down? He's never been one to hide behind anybody.",
jbnoo3x,reddevils,11nl59m,That is such a Wout goal (even though he hasn‚Äôt scored a lot yet),
jbnpdfj,reddevils,11nl59m,"I hope Pellistri gets more game time. I think Antony could do with the competition to improve his consistency. Plus, he can't play every game.",
jbnvnr2,reddevils,11nl59m,"I love Bruno. 

Genuinely can‚Äôt believe the vitriol and hatred that gets from people. Like I‚Äôll say ‚ÄúI hate Ag√ºero‚Äù but, obviously I don‚Äôt actually hate him. He‚Äôs just a guy that scored goals for a rival team. It‚Äôs all fun and games.

But, the way people talk about Bruno you‚Äôd swear he committed war crimes. Talking about his family, his character as a human being. It‚Äôs just crossing the line. 

There are potential rapists that get less hate than Bruno.",
jbnvsqh,reddevils,11nl59m,Pellistri should've earned a start in the 2nd leg.,
jbnrw4h,reddevils,11nl59m,Gary told me that hug was secret code meaning he loves the Annfield sign. The mirror is reporting.,
jbnootl,reddevils,11nl59m,MY CAPTAIN!,
jbnql3p,reddevils,11nl59m,We can talk about Bruno now?,
jbnxrp1,reddevils,11nl59m,"Great angle of the goal - you can see it‚Äôs a worked on routine with big Weg bully his marker out the way leaving Pellistri clear. Also having conditioned the left back on going inside with Antony was a very well worked goal. VISIONS

ps. Bruno played out his skin and is always my cap‚Äôn. but haters gon hate.",
jc1ju7j,reddevils,11q6t4a,I think the lack of consistency is the main complaint that I have seen,
jc1k3gt,reddevils,11q6t4a,"If people want to maintain that Casemiro's card was a red, that's fine, I'm sure we can accept that even begrudgingly. The issue is the clear inconsistency by referees from game to game.",
jc1k5fx,reddevils,11q6t4a,The KWP two footed tackle through AG was worse. Taylor and Marriner need to face repercussions for this. Twice this season we‚Äôve had players face potential serious injuries and there wasn‚Äôt even a yellow given.,
jc1kc9l,reddevils,11q6t4a,"The most ridiculous part;

One scenario there is a legitimate attempt at the ball and perhaps some intentional afters; we'll never legitimately know . . . .

The other scenario is well after the ball is gone; not even a remote possibility that this was a challenge for a ball - nothing but blatant intentional contact.  Again, we may never know if the player intended to injure an opponent, but under these circumstances, there's basically no doubt that there was intent to foul and in doing so the opponent was needlessly endangered.",
jc1jtgk,reddevils,11q6t4a,"Well, this is the second time Casemiro gets a controversial red card, it's not ok.",
jc1kn8n,reddevils,11q6t4a,"There appeared to be an agenda! Otherwise how does that motherfucking Southampton defender, crawling on all fours, stopping the ball with his arm not constitute a penalty? Wasn't even VAR reviewed!?",
jc1lmb0,reddevils,11q6t4a,"I usually stay away from ref analysis stuff like this as I usually associate that with being a delusional Arsenal fan but on this occasion I can't help but feel that something fishy is going on.

Casemiro red was harsh but I understand the concept that the tackle was uncontrolled and endangered the other player. However the walker peters tackle was also uncontrolled and did literally injure the other player and yet wasn't even a foul? Both instances the defender got the ball but was maybe a little reckless.

The handball was probably as much as a stonewall pen as you can get. The ball travels a good 20 yards and nobody can say the hand was in a natural position unless you always run about with your hands on the ground.

IMO 1 bad reffing decision with terrible inconsistency followed by a reffing decision which is borderline corruption.",
jc1omsu,reddevils,11q6t4a,"One was redirected by the ball, the other was not.",
jc1phnf,reddevils,11q6t4a,"I do think Case was a red, if it was other way around lets be honest we‚Äôd be screaming for a red

But the consistency is horrendous. That‚Äôs either a red all the time or it isn‚Äôt. 

Also that handball pen ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è how is that not a pen ffs.",
jc1l17d,reddevils,11q6t4a,Casemiros is a red card *if* the refs were consistent this season but it‚Äôs not a red card now considering the amount of times tackles like this happen every week with no card given or no VAR intervention for every other team.,
jbmkbyc,reddevils,11nc4wq,Man I love Casemiro so much,
jbml15q,reddevils,11nc4wq,"The last time he score in a cup, we won that cup ;)",
jbmohaq,reddevils,11nc4wq,"I think it was a huge relief for him- that celebration was the ""fucking finally"" moment. Maybe it means he'll play a bit more relaxed now, he was definitely a bit on edge and under pressure. Huge goal for him mentally, but also for the team to gain a bit more separation for the second leg.",
jbmmp2n,reddevils,11nc4wq,Happy for Wout'w goal but Pellistri was so good though,
jbmrmp3,reddevils,11nc4wq,Reminds me of Dan James 1st goal celebration,
jbmkhz0,reddevils,11nc4wq,Beautiful. It looks like he has exhausted all his pent-up emotions at the end of that knee slide.,
jbmiyrk,reddevils,11nc4wq,I‚Äôve watched this so many times and my goodness the goosebumps I get from his roar post-knee slide üòç,
jbmjupb,reddevils,11nc4wq,"Tears in my eyes and his eyes.

Hope he can get another few trophies by the end of the season.",
jbms9ep,reddevils,11nc4wq,How can you not love a player for who it means so much to score for that badge? He may not be the most talented striker but he gives his all every game.,
jbmpss8,reddevils,11nc4wq,"Love it. Looks on the verge of tears he's so happy lol. Can tell that meant a lot and he's been so close to scoring in the last few games.

Honestly really want us to sign him in the summer. He's not going to play as much if we get a striker in the summer but he can certainly pitch in next season as 3rd or 4th striker. We need more players like him just with extra quality (without being horrible)",

jd7vax6,reddevils,11yj2ij,It's no coincidence that our form has dipped without him. Casemiro's influence is obviously evident. But Eriksen is super important in the scheme of things. He has been greatly missed.,

jb5ct1j,LiverpoolFC,11k1squ,"Lots of posts get created about time wasting but I think play acting is a bigger problem. 

I think if players tell the ref how to do his job and tell him who he should be booking they should also receive a card their job is  to play so just play. This also includes surrounding the referee as only the captain's are allowed to approach the ref so give cards to others that do it so it stops. 

Also players that dive, over exaggerate challenges and fake injuries to time waste should be booked too. This includes players who get their shirts touched and roll around like they've been shot. Players who get touched on the chest and fall like a house of cards holding their head like they've been assaulted. Players like Grealish who falls so much he's either playing in slippers or he's tripping over his own shadow. 

Also there needs to be changes about possible head injures as many teams are abusing the system. If a player goes down holding his head because the opposite team is on the counter attack and he knows that the ref has to stop play because of head injuries. If VAR realises this is acting to manipulate the referees they should receive yellow cards too as it's embarrassing to watch and gives the sport a bad name.

Fernandes does all of the above

Another point from this game was that Salah received a yellow card for removing his shirt yet Fernandes went unpunished for pushing the referees asst so explain that one.................",-0.3

Why are you not commenting this afternoon?

Honestly feels like the Grealish haters would rather see us lose than have Grealish winning games.

""it's weird that grealish gets more backing than mahrez who has done a lot more.""

""am i tweaking or pep can't see that mahrez and grealish both on the wing does nothing for us....""

""i don't understand what pep sees in jack that he needs to keep foden on the bench for him, even cole palmer who is a little to selfish looks better on the left""

""grealish keeping possession with a thousand back passes""

""grealish as cam? he hardly creates as much foden or gundo could from that position""

""frustrating watching mahrez and grealish give rodri the ball a million times""

""enlighten me? acting like grealish is a good and can't be easily replaced or bench we would still create enough damage""

""watching football since 2010, what is possible there that i wouldn't know? next you're gonna tell me jack grealish is worth 100m?""

""simply said he's being overrated for doing things that are ordinary, you're behaving as if grealish is doing some life changing things for our team""

u/exciseduty

Where are you?

""27 year old and 100m¬£ and nothing to show for it. Btw what excuses are being made for him now? Earlier it was he will come good in second season, which he hasn't in short time he hasn't.
